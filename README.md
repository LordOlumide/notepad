# notepad

A notepad made using my Android phone's default notepad as reference.
It uses SQLite as the database.

## Goals

This project is a personal one made to learn how to:
- use SQLite in practice,
- write tests for flutter widgets,
- use Themes to set light mode and dark mode based on system settings,
- output desktop apps,
- create a good search bar,

Perhaps, I will add reminders that will notify the user with push notifications.
The challenge is how to do this offline.
