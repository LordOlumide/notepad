# notepad

A notepad made using my Android phone's default notepad as reference.
It uses SQLite as the database.

What's left:
- Themes

## Goals

This project is a personal one made to learn how to:
- use SQLite in practice,                             ✅
- write tests for flutter widgets,                    --
- light and dark themes based on system settings,     --
- output desktop app,                                 --
- create a good search bar,                           ✅

Perhaps, I will add reminders that will notify the user with push notifications.
The challenge is how to do this offline.
